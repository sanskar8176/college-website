# college-website
College website is a web-based application which will help the students to get the 
information regarding that college.
The Students (users) can access the information displayed on the website. We have 
displayed the information of all the department present in that college. The 
information of the faculty of each department. The pictures and details of the 
infrastructure of the college, the departments and the labs.
